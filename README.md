## [Hotel Demand Analysis](https://github.com/Qin-Datahub/EDA/blob/main/hotel_demand_analysis_with_plotly.ipynb)

### About the Dataset

We will use the [hotel booking demand dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand?resource=download) for the demo. It contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

A thorough analysis of this dataset helps us answer questions such as the best time of year to book a hotel room, or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate.
